Question 1

Create a class called Student that includes three pieces of information as instance variables—a name, a roll number, marks and attendance. Your class should have a constructor that initializes the three instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. If the marks are not positive, set it to 0.0. Write a test application named StudentTest that demonstrates class Student’s capabilities. Create two Student objects. Then give each Student a 10% raise in marks if their attendance is greater than 75% and display each Student’s marks again. If after increasing their marks it becomes greater than 100, set it to 100.0.
